# Core Processing Components

## 1. Query Parser

The Query Parser analyzes and interprets user inputs to extract meaningful intent and parameters for the finance assistant.

### Key Features

- **Intent Recognition**: Identifies the core financial intent of user queries
- **Entity Extraction**: Recognizes financial entities like amounts, dates, accounts, and instruments
- **Parameter Identification**: Extracts variables needed for financial calculations
- **Query Classification**: Categorizes queries by financial domain (investments, taxes, budgeting, etc.)
- **Ambiguity Resolution**: Handles unclear or incomplete financial queries
- **Multi-language Support**: Processes queries in various languages
- **Contextual Understanding**: Considers previous conversation for interpretation
- **Financial Jargon Processing**: Recognizes specialized financial terminology

### Technical Implementation

- **NLP Pipeline**: Tokenization, POS tagging, dependency parsing
- **Intent Classification Model**: Fine-tuned for financial domain queries
- **Named Entity Recognition**: Custom model for financial entities
- **Context Window Management**: Tracking of relevant conversation history
- **Spelling Correction**: Domain-specific correction for financial terms
- **Confidence Scoring**: Reliability metrics for parsed interpretations
- **Fallback Mechanisms**: Handling for unrecognized queries

### Development Priorities

1. **Basic Parsing**: Core intent and entity extraction
2. **Financial Entity Recognition**: Identification of common financial entities
3. **Contextual Processing**: Incorporation of conversation context
4. **Disambiguation**: Handling of unclear financial queries
5. **Domain Expansion**: Support for specialized financial sub-domains

## 2. Context Manager

The Context Manager maintains the state and flow of financial conversations, ensuring coherent and relevant interactions.

### Key Features

- **Conversation State Tracking**: Maintains the current status of the interaction
- **Financial Profile Integration**: Links conversation to user's financial profile
- **Memory Management**: Stores and retrieves relevant conversation history
- **Context Prioritization**: Identifies most relevant context for current query
- **Topic Switching Detection**: Recognizes when user changes financial topics
- **Reference Resolution**: Resolves references to previously mentioned financial items
- **Context Visualization**: Provides interface to show active context (for debugging)
- **Forgetfulness Prevention**: Ensures critical financial details aren't lost

### Technical Implementation

- **State Machine**: Tracks conversation progress through financial topics
- **Context Store**: Efficient storage of conversation state
- **Attention Mechanism**: Focuses on relevant parts of conversation history
- **Reference Graph**: Maintains connections between related conversation elements
- **Topic Segmentation**: Divides conversation into meaningful financial topics
- **Context Window**: Sliding window of relevant conversation history
- **Entity Tracking**: Follows mentioned financial entities throughout conversation

### Development Priorities

1. **Basic State Tracking**: Implementation of conversation state machine
2. **Context Storage**: Development of efficient context storage system
3. **Reference Resolution**: Implementation of reference tracking
4. **Topic Management**: Topic change detection and handling
5. **Profile Integration**: Linking context to persistent user financial profiles

## 3. Response Formatter

The Response Formatter transforms raw agent outputs into clear, helpful, and appropriate responses for users.

### Key Features

- **Format Standardization**: Ensures consistent response structure
- **Personalization**: Tailors responses to user preferences and financial literacy
- **Simplification**: Makes complex financial concepts accessible
- **Visual Enhancement**: Integrates charts and visualizations when appropriate
- **Multi-format Support**: Delivers responses as text, structured data, or rich media
- **Language Adaptation**: Adjusts language complexity based on user profile
- **Tone Management**: Maintains appropriate tone for financial discussions
- **Action Embedding**: Includes actionable steps in financial advice

### Technical Implementation

- **Template System**: Response templates for common financial scenarios
- **Dynamic Assembly**: Combines multiple information sources into coherent responses
- **Markdown Processing**: Support for rich text formatting
- **Visualization Integration**: Embeds financial charts and graphs
- **Personalization Engine**: Adapts responses based on user profile
- **Readability Analysis**: Ensures appropriate complexity level
- **Response Validation**: Checks for completeness and accuracy

### Development Priorities

1. **Base Formatting**: Core text response formatting
2. **Template System**: Development of financial response templates
3. **Personalization**: Basic response adaptation based on user profile
4. **Visual Integration**: Incorporation of charts and visualizations
5. **Multi-modal Responses**: Support for various response types

## Integration Points

The Core Processing Components integrate with other system modules through:

- **User Interface**: For receiving queries and delivering responses
- **Agent System**: For routing interpreted queries and formatting agent outputs
- **User Profile System**: For accessing personalization data
- **Visualization System**: For embedding visual elements in responses
- **Long-Term Memory**: For retrieving relevant historical context

## Technical Requirements

- **Latency**: < 100ms for query parsing, < 200ms for response formatting
- **Accuracy**: > 95% intent recognition for common financial queries
- **Scalability**: Support for concurrent conversations
- **Language Support**: Initially English, with extensibility to other languages
- **Accessibility**: Compliance with readability standards

## Future Enhancements

- **Multimodal Input Processing**: Support for voice and image-based queries
- **Emotion Detection**: Recognition of user sentiment for more empathetic responses
- **Cultural Adaptation**: Culturally appropriate financial communication
- **Explainability Layer**: Transparent reasoning for financial advice
- **Interactive Responses**: Two-way interactive elements in responses

These Core Processing Components form the central nervous system of the Finance Assistant Chatbot, ensuring accurate interpretation of user needs and clear communication of financial information and advice.
