# Agent System Components

## 1. Agent Router

The Agent Router intelligently directs user queries to the most appropriate specialized financial agents based on intent and context.

### Key Features

- **Intent-based Routing**: Matches financial queries to specialized agents
- **Multi-agent Coordination**: Routes complex queries to multiple relevant agents
- **Confidence Scoring**: Evaluates routing decisions with confidence metrics
- **Fallback Handling**: Manages cases where appropriate agent is unclear
- **Dynamic Prioritization**: Adjusts routing based on query urgency and complexity
- **Domain Mapping**: Maintains mappings between financial domains and agents
- **Load Balancing**: Distributes queries efficiently across agent instances
- **A/B Testing**: Supports testing of alternative routing strategies

### Technical Implementation

- **Intent Classification**: Machine learning model for financial intent classification
- **Routing Rules Engine**: Configurable rules for agent selection
- **Agent Capability Registry**: Database of agent capabilities and domains
- **Confidence Calculation**: Algorithms for assessing routing confidence
- **Performance Monitoring**: Metrics collection for routing effectiveness
- **Feedback Loop**: Learning from successful and unsuccessful routing decisions
- **Configuration Management**: Tools for adjusting routing behavior

### Development Priorities

1. **Basic Routing**: Simple intent-to-agent mapping
2. **Multi-agent Routing**: Support for complex queries requiring multiple agents
3. **Confidence Metrics**: Quantification of routing decision confidence
4. **Fallback Strategies**: Graceful handling when routing is uncertain
5. **Performance Optimization**: Routing efficiency and accuracy improvements

## 2. Agent Coordinator

The Agent Coordinator orchestrates interactions between multiple financial agents to handle complex queries requiring diverse expertise.

### Key Features

- **Workflow Management**: Choreographs multi-step financial analyses
- **Information Sharing**: Facilitates data exchange between agents
- **Conflict Resolution**: Resolves contradictions in agent outputs
- **Sequential Processing**: Manages agent execution order for complex financial queries
- **Parallel Execution**: Runs independent agent tasks simultaneously
- **Progress Tracking**: Monitors the status of multi-agent processes
- **Timeout Management**: Handles agent non-responsiveness
- **Composite Response Assembly**: Combines outputs from multiple agents

### Technical Implementation

- **Workflow Engine**: LangGraph-based system for agent coordination
- **State Management**: Shared state for multi-agent collaborations
- **Message Bus**: Communication channel between agents
- **Execution Scheduler**: Optimizes agent execution sequence
- **Conflict Detection**: Identifies and resolves contradictory financial advice
- **Result Aggregation**: Combines results from multiple agents coherently
- **Error Handling**: Manages agent failures with graceful degradation

### Development Priorities

1. **Sequential Workflows**: Basic agent sequencing capabilities
2. **State Sharing**: Implementation of shared state between agents
3. **Result Compilation**: Assembly of multi-agent responses
4. **Parallel Processing**: Support for concurrent agent execution
5. **Error Handling**: Robust handling of agent failures

## 3. Agent State Tracker

The Agent State Tracker maintains and manages the state of agent interactions throughout complex financial conversations.

### Key Features

- **State Persistence**: Maintains agent state between user interactions
- **Conversation Threading**: Tracks multiple conversation threads
- **State Visualization**: Provides visibility into current agent state
- **State Rollback**: Supports returning to previous conversation states
- **Checkpointing**: Creates savepoints during extended financial analyses
- **Context Windowing**: Manages relevant context size for efficiency
- **State Synchronization**: Ensures consistency across distributed agents
- **State Encryption**: Secures sensitive financial state information

### Technical Implementation

- **State Store**: Efficient storage for agent state data
- **Serialization System**: Converts agent state to/from persistent format
- **Transaction Management**: Ensures atomic state updates
- **Change Tracking**: Records modifications to agent state
- **Caching Layer**: Improves performance for state access
- **Cleanup Mechanisms**: Manages state lifecycle and garbage collection
- **Recovery Systems**: Handles state corruption or loss

### Development Priorities

1. **State Storage**: Basic persistence of agent state
2. **State Lifecycle**: Management of state creation and disposal
3. **Synchronization**: Consistency management for distributed agents
4. **Security**: Protection of sensitive financial state data
5. **Performance**: Optimization for efficient state operations

## Integration Points

The Agent System Components integrate with other system modules through:

- **Core Processing**: Receives parsed queries and returns responses for formatting
- **LLM Integration**: Connects to language models for agent reasoning
- **Knowledge Base**: Accesses financial information and regulations
- **Long-Term Memory**: Retrieves relevant historical context
- **Financial Tools**: Utilizes calculation and analysis tools

## Technical Requirements

- **Response Time**: Agent routing decisions in < 50ms
- **Scalability**: Support for hundreds of concurrent agent workflows
- **Reliability**: 99.9% successful completion of multi-agent workflows
- **Monitoring**: Comprehensive visibility into agent operations
- **Extensibility**: Easy addition of new specialized agents

## Future Enhancements
